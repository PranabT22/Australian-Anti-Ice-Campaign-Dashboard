    <h1>About AAIC</h1>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p><b>Our vision</b> is to cultivate a future where Australian youth and communities are empowered with knowledge and resilience, leading to a society free from the devastating impacts of ice. We envision a nation that recognizes the true nature of ice as a destructive and addictive poison, fostering environments that support prevention, recovery, and healthy choices.</p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p><b>Our mission</b> is to educate all Australians—particularly our youth—about the dangers and devastating impact of ice, helping to prevent addiction before it begins. Through awareness, community engagement, and lived-experience education, we aim to put the freeze on ice, promoting the message: <i>“Ice, not even once,”</i> and building a healthier, safer future for all Australians. We are also committed to empowering individuals already struggling with addiction by guiding them toward positive pathways for long-term recovery and renewed hope.</p>
