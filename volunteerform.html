(Please see attachment for further information).\n\nThe Tripod of Support in the first 3 months of recovery is weekly counselling, weekly meetings (AA/NA) and weekly sponsor. It is recommended that this weekly contact continues for 12 months, however if the Tripod Team agree that the person has extensive support from their family, friends and Church Community, then they may be able to reduce to fortnightly. It is highly desirable that the fortnightly contact continues for at least 1 year before it reduces to monthly.
